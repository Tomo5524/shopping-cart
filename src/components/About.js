        â€œEverybody has a little bit of the sun and moon in them. Everybody has a
        little bit of man, woman, and animal in them. Darks and lights in them.
        Everyone is part of a connected cosmic system. Part earth and sea, wind
        and fire, with some salt and dust swimming in them. We have a universe
        within ourselves that mimics the universe outside. None of us are just
        black or white, or never wrong and always right. No one. No one exists
        without polarities. Everybody has good and bad forces working with them,
        against them, and within them.
